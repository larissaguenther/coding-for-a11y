# Semantic HTML

## What is semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning and the content they are supposed to contain to developers and the browser.  
Especially screen readers rely on native HTML semantics.

Semantic elements are for example `<table>`, `<form>` or `<section>` - they all have a clearly defined content.

Non-semantic elements are for example `<div>` and `<span>` - they tell nothing about their content.

## How do I use semantic HTML while developing?

- Use native semantic HTML elements rather than trying to create your own elements
- When adding a new element to your UI think about what this element is supposed to do or contain, then search in the web if there is a native HTML element for that functionality
