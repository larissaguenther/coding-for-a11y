        <h3>General Information</h3>
        <p>
          The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous
          mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and
          is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the
          wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm
          cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
          Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability
          to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
          registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species:
          it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and
          retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
          sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes
          vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
          grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is
          most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary
          hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high
          in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other
          small mammals. Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.

          Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with
          litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are
          bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
          as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected by spaying
          and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has
          resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
          extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species. Cats were
          first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC. It was long
          thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were
          venerated from around 3100 BC. As of 2021, there are an estimated 220
          million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of
          2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United
          States, with 95 million cats owned.[16][17][18] In the United Kingdom,
          26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million
          pet cats as of 2020.

        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>
          Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places,
          or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which
          to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a
          tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat
          a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat
          falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and
          land on its paws. During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively
          twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute
          sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the cat
          righting reflex. A cat always rights itself in the same way during a
          fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90
          cm (2 ft 11 in) or more. How cats are able to right themselves when
          falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".
